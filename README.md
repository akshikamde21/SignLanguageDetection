# Sign Language Detection
Sign language is a complete visual language used primarily by the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community. It has its own grammar, vocabulary, syntax, and unique linguistic features. However, it can be challenging for Deaf individuals to communicate with those unfamiliar with sign language. 
Indian Sign Language (ISL) differs from other international sign languages, necessitating specific recognition techniques. To address this, a system was developed that takes video inputs of gestures, uses MediaPipe for feature extraction (hand and body keypoints), and employs a deep learning LSTM model to recognize sign movements, addressing frame dependency. A dataset with twelve vocabularies, each containing 30 videos, was created, and experiments showed the model achieved over 91% accuracy in recognition.
